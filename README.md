# Anki Word Adder (AWA)
AWA is a web-app that helps to learn English words with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
It's main purpose is to reduce the amount of manual work in the process of adding new cards.
 
## The problem and the solution
#### There're two ways of using Anki to learn English:
<ol>
  <li>Download existing deck (collection of words) that someone else created</li>
  <li>Add words yourself one by one</li>
</ol>

#### Both ways have their flaws:
<ol>
  <li>
    Downloading decks may be good to learn your first words,
    but if you are not a beginner, there will be a lot of words you already know.
    <br />
    And what is most important, they won't have your unique context in which the word was found
    (for example a sentence in a book you're reading). So this way is less efficient than adding words yourself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding words manually is great for learning, but translating and looking for definitions takes a lot of
    time.
    It is even more if you want to add audio and pictures to your cards.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Solution:
AWA takes the best of them: you will be adding new words yourself, thereby keeping your
context and learning more efficiently, but the amount of manual work will be reduced to a couple of clicks.
